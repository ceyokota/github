                When reading “Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows” by Naema Baskanderi, I found the opening paragraph really interesting, as it rings true that we have become habituated to immediately closing modals when they pop up since they're usually ads or feels like a blockage to the main content. I thought point number 6 about avoiding modals popping up by themselves and instead, always have them step from user input was really insightful and made a lot of sense.
            </p>
            <p>
               Another thing I found interesting is how it talked about modal size. Something that I've been noticing in the modals I design for my internship is that my mentor always asks me how the modal size should adapt (expand or shrink) based on the content, and what the maximum height should be. I always thought that choosing a modal's size was difficult because you have to think about responsiveness and scalability, but also make sure that the user doesn't have to scroll too much in the modal because it can result in bad user experience, as the article mentions. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The last thing I wanted to point out from the article is how it talks about accessibility in terms of keyboard usage. I thought it was really interesting that everything regarding a mobile should be navagatable with a keyboard only, and shouldn't require the user to use their mouse to move through it. I never really considered keyboard shortcuts as accessibility, but it makes a lot of sense that you want your content to be easy to navigate regardless of what the user is using.

                When reading “Best practice in form design” by Salim Ansari, I found all the information really interesting. When filling out forms, I normally don’t really think about how they’re designed, and how to optimize the experience, but all the points made in the article made a lot of sense as to why they helped improve the user experience. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also working on form design in my part-time internship currently, and I found a lot of the points made were things I was doing but I didn’t know why I was doing it. The article helped clear up the logic and reasoning behind these decisions by tying it to important cognitive and psychological effects on the user, which I felt was extremely helpful. For example, making a zip code text box a lot shorter than an email text box was something that I was doing intuitively, but the article explaining that the length of the text box helps easily communicate what the form is expecting as an input really helps ground my design decisions.

                A website I've interacted with before that exemplifies best practices is Airtable. Using the standard one-column layout, good positioning on labels, placeholder text, and also shortening text boxes based on the expected input are all things that Airtable implemented in their forms to improve the user experience.
