                When reading “Best practice in form design” by Salim Ansari, I found all the information really interesting. When filling out forms, I normally don’t really think about how they’re designed, and how to optimize the experience, but all the points made in the article made a lot of sense as to why they helped improve the user experience.

                I am also working on form design in my part-time internship currently, and I found a lot of the points made were things I was doing but I didn’t know why I was doing it. The article helped clear up the logic and reasoning behind these decisions by tying it to important cognitive and psychological effects on the user, which I felt was extremely helpful. For example, making a zip code text box a lot shorter than an email text box was something that I was doing intuitively, but the article explaining that the length of the text box helps easily communicate what the form is expecting as an input really helps ground my design decisions.

                A website I've interacted with before that exemplifies best practices is Airtable. Using the standard one-column layout, good positioning on labels, placeholder text, and also shortening text boxes based on the expected input are all things that Airtable implemented in their forms to improve the user experience.
